Role of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in the context of Alzheimer's Disease (AD)

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a prevalent internal modification of messenger RNA (mRNA) that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including RNA stability, splicing, translation, and degradation. In the context of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), m6A regulators—methyltransferases, demethylases, and binding proteins—are gaining attention for their potential involvement in disease mechanisms.


**Specific m6A Regulators in AD**

_METTL3/METTL14_: These are the core m6A methyltransferases. Their activity is linked to the stability and expression of mRNAs related to neuronal function. Dysregulation may promote the neurodegenerative processes seen in AD.

_FTO and ALKBH5_: These demethylases can reverse m6A modifications. Their altered expression may affect the turnover of mRNAs involved in neurodegeneration, thus influencing the progression of AD.

_YTH Domain Family Proteins:_ These proteins recognize and bind m6A-modified mRNAs, playing a role in their stability and translation. Changes in their expression could impact the translational landscape in AD-affected regions.
